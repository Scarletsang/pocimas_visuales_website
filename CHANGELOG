# V2

Using lit js to manage web components. To compromise this change which facilitates data-driven rendering, the backend is rendering the website data in JSON.

Frontend has been splitted into the following parts:

## nodePointer.js

The core class. A singleton class controlling the current node of the website. This is the class that interfaces with the web componenets. Every function here can be used in the web components.

## nodeWalker.js

A private class responsible for calculating the path that the nodes can be walked. It traverses (walks) the nodes to make certain decisions. This class is called by nodePointer class.

## /components

contains all code related to web components.

**componentController.js**: provide a base for the web component to update when the url hash is changed.

## /models

contains all the interface that grab data from the raw JSON.

**nodeInquiry.js**: A public interface to get information of a node.

**nodeData.js**: A private interface to get information from the original data related to the content.

**nodeScopes.js**: A private interface to get information about the scope of the nodes.

# V1

Before 14 February (Unrecorded date)
- *Backend*: 
	- wrote a custom markdown plugin for the kramdown markdown parser to process received markdown documents into html.
	- TODO: Defined a structure for the markdown and yaml document for content management. Until this structure is done, the server is hosting the content statically.
- *Frontend*: 
	- Complete the basic css styling of the home page and content page.
	- TODO: Finished dynmaic rendering on frontend.

14 February 
- *Frontend*: 
	-	Finished dynamic rendering pages from url hash change.
	- Finished rendering different structures of pages.
	- TODO: css styling of the inner pages.
	- TODO: Dynamic page rendering further debug.

15 February
- *Backend*:
  - Added parsing for audio and video
	- Fiinished connecting up the backend and frontend.
	- TODO: Parsing for container contents in markdown (choice view and recipe view)

17 February
- *Frontend*:
  - Finished most of the structural css styling.
	- Improved Node wandering functions by adding a NodeHistory object.
	- TODO: pre-download media of one page ahead to minimize latancy of image loading between nodes.
	- TODO: More css styling after getting comments from Cristina.
- *Backend*:
  - Completed all custom markdown parsing: gallery tag, section tag, video tag, audio tag and side-by-side sections (left tag and right tag).
	- Added a route to dynamically grab media from server.

20 February
- *Frontend*:
  - Cache downloaded media. Nodes are no longer cloned but moved between the content container and hidden container with the id "#cache".
	- Media will be downloaded one page before, so to decrease time for the audience to wait for media to download when they switch page.
	- Horizontal scroll are set to be passive (if this feature is found in the browser) to improve performance for the browser to handle the "wheel" event with the native code.
- *Backend*:
  - FIXED BUG: Wrong return value of the get route that causes sinatra to interpret it as a rack respond, yielding an error to process it.
	- Rendering changed so to adhere to the cache download media feature.

21 February
- *Frontend*:
  - Added popup gallery image function. (tested)
	- Added popup pdf function. (not yet tested)
- *Backend*:
  - Added markdown parsing for pdf
	- Added popup container in haml for image and pdf popups.

22 February
- *Frontend*:
  - complete most css styles, including showing pdf
- *Backend*:
  - Finished debugging parsing for pdf tag in markdown.

24 February
- *Frontend*:
  - Refactored code for rendering different page structures. Each structure is now defined in a seperate class. A new structure just requires one to add a new class and add it to the route function.

9 March
- *Backend*:
  - reorganizes the server code to be split into production and development mode. In production mode, precompilation of the whole site is done using HAML precompiled together with rollup js for bundling up all its relavant files to be hosted statically.
