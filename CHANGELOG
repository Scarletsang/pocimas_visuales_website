Before 14 February (Unrecorded date)
- *Backend*: 
	- wrote a custom markdown plugin for the kramdown markdown parser to process received markdown documents into html.

- *Backend*:
  - Completed all custom markdown parsing: gallery tag, section tag, video tag, audio tag and side-by-side sections (left tag and right tag).
	- Added a route to dynamically grab media from server.

20 February
- *Frontend*:
  - Cache downloaded media. Nodes are no longer cloned but moved between the content container and hidden container with the id "#cache".
	- Media will be downloaded one page before, so to decrease time for the audience to wait for media to download when they switch page.
	- Horizontal scroll are set to be passive (if this feature is found in the browser) to improve performance for the browser to handle the "wheel" event with the native code.
- *Backend*:
  - FIXED BUG: Wrong return value of the get route that causes sinatra to interpret it as a rack respond, yielding an error to process it.
	- Rendering changed so to adhere to the cache download media feature.

21 February
- *Frontend*:
  - Added popup gallery image function. (tested)
	- Added popup pdf function. (not yet tested)
- *Backend*:

	- Added popup container in haml for image and pdf popups.

24 February
- *Frontend*:
  - Refactored code for rendering different page structures. Each structure is now defined in a seperate class. A new structure just requires one to add a new class and add it to the route function.

9 March
- *Backend*:
  - reorganizes the server code to be split into production and development mode. In production mode, precompilation of the whole site is done using HAML precompiled together with rollup js for bundling up all its relavant files to be hosted statically.
